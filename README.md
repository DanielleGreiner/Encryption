I made an application that will take any user input and encrypt it. 
As you know you did want a length restriction on input so I did add that as some validation. 
After that the input was encrypted using a AES cipher as AES is one of the better ciphers out there, 
as it is highly resistant to cracking and greatly supported among the IT community. 
Once the input was encrypted it was inserted into a file and read from there, 
as the encrypted data was printed to the console for the user to see. 
I did have some difficulty figuring out how to decrypt from a file,
as I had just decrypted the input itself instead of going through the process 
of reading it from the file to do decryption. The value that the user inputed 
is then printed back to them in the console.
